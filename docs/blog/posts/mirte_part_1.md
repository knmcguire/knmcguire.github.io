_I've spent some days building the low-cost open source educational robot developed by TU Delft! Here a short blogpost describing that experience and some ideas and plans of projects I could possibly do with it. It's an awesome platform_

So when I decided with a little career break before starting anything new, I had a whole list of things and projects that I'd like to do, but I haven't been super successful with that.
The first month of that was... intersting in the sense that I've started all kinds of art projects, just to figure out I'm bad at origami.
At least I've managed to exercise a lot, eat well, and finish off Spiderman 2 on the Playstation 5 (I highly recommend this game).
But after FOSDEM I've gotten the urge to create something again, and perhaps the inspiration of being there helped with that.
I digitally 'recreated' my personal website (see the blogpost right here), but I'm a robotics engineer... at one point I'd like to make something physical, with sensors that move. 

I'm very glad that on a previous trip to my old university town, Martin Klomp borrowed me building materials to build the Mirte, an fully open source robot that the TU Delft has developed for educational purposed. 
I knew Martin from my time at the organizing committee of the Robocup Junior (NL) competition in the Netherlands, so this is a project that has come from all that shared experience of needing a good standard mobile robot for kids and students alike.
THis platform is and will be used in their university clases in robotics as well, so I'm excited to try it out.

So I got the building materials for the Mirte pioneer (see the picture here above), but there are other versions as well, that have less capabilities but more suitable for kids or students who are just getting started.
I've made a picture of everything that came in the box, which are all off the shelf.
The version I had did had the 'Mirte PCB'm of which the KiCad files are availabe under the CERN open hardware licence, but the Mirte website also provide instructions to connect all the sensors through wires and a breadboard. Also I've gotten a whole bunch of sensors like sonar, camera, infraredsensors and some screens. How will it all fit!

So once I've covered all the materials, I followed the building instructions on the mirte website.
It had visual instructions that made it quite easy to put thing together. But I was more impressed with the clever design of the base itself.
The Orange board and the mirte pcb were attched with screws along with some sensors, but the base itself could be assembled without the use of even one screw.
Even the motors for the wheels could be easily clicked into place.
Also, in the front part of the base, there were modules for the sensors such that could be clicked in facing forward, and changed to other sensors depended on the application of the project.
This is a very handy feature
