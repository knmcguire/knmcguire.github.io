I've taken a couple of months of a career break, but I'm finally ready to take the next step... to start for myself! Yes, you heard me correctly, I'm going to be self-employed :smile: ! After talking to a couple of people that are already freelancing within the business, I am prettyy convinced that I'll be wawnting to go into this direction. So here a blogpost to explain a bit of my reasoning, my updated portfolio and which kind of assignments I'll be looking for.

## Why Freelancing

So freelancing or independent contracting tends to have the reputation of not being a stable source of income or the risk of not having a certainty of employment. Eventhoguh the first might be indeed a valid reason (although it depends on what kind of assignment you except), the second might not be valid in this day and age. Robotics seems to be booming, and if nto anything, going to ERF has convinced me even more than that, so there are many smaller companies looking for robotic contractors at the moment. However, do ask me in a year or 2 if I still feel this way, as I still yet have to get started and receive assignments. But all of those are logical reasonings ofcourse.

My personal reason why freelancing attract me so is that, is the independence aspect of it. To be able to have the freedom to choose the assignments I'm interested in, to choose the people I'd like to work with and to learn what I want to learn, and to leave when projects don't align. That is such a powerfull part of independent contracting that I feel that I resonate with, which will not only be benificial for my own career, but also for the companies I'll be working for. They won't be fixed to me and I'm not to them, but ofcourse we all will be hoping to build a good relationship.

Networking seems to be a very important part of freelancing as well, as it seems that the best assignments come from the word of mouth through people who know you. I am quite active on LinkedIn and I love going to conference and talking to/meeting new people. I just have to start getting better in remembering names, as last ROSCon I hit my limit already on the first day! I have an hope still for AR in glasses to still become a thing, but until now I need to start using momemic devices.

And finally, freelancing in robotics tends to be quite competitive. It is therefore important to keep learning as the field constantly evolves. Today it's LLM powered arm, tomorrow will be ZRN-powered soft robotic fish (I made ZRN up obviously). And that is something that I felt the need for to do for the recent years after I finished my PhD. Sure I've managed to transition to ROS2 and Gazebo/webots, and did gamedevelopment during Corona, but my quantum computing beginners course remains untouched! Not sure if the latter course has anything to do with robotics but you never know!

## My new portfolio :fontawesome-solid-star:

With this new phase of my career, also comes with yet another update of my website. When I [rebuild my website](/blog/2025/02/14/first-blogpost/#how-did-i-make-the-website-and-blog) almost 2 months ago, I started using [mkdocs for materials](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) which I very much love! I didn't had to change that much to the theme then, but I have done quite some changes now, starting with a good update of [my about page](/) which now includes contact information, my skills and a shortform of my CV (which you can find as pdf right under my summary.)

I've also updated [my projects page](/projects) as well, which was first just a whole bunch of links that diverted people to other project pages. Now, it lists each of the projects under a different subheader, with a short summary and relevant links to papers, videos and project pages. And this is accomendating with a list of skills project that comes with it as well! I still have to figure out what to do with skills that I've accumulated during the job but not as part of a project (like I've worked with CI and docker quite a bit but not really part of the fun ROS2 with the crazyflie project), but I'll figure that one out as I go. Also there might be better terms to give to certain skills... or I just give it all the skill embodied AI and be done with it :smile: (just kidding ofcourse!)

But the best thing, and I'm a little proud of this as well, is that I've build in a macro, that collects all the skills from my project page, accumulates them on my about page and those that occure the most has a :fontawesome-solid-start:. Pretty cool right!? And there is more... you can click on them! If you do, a search bar will open that will search the full website on occurances of that term (so you can actually check if i'm an proficient in said skill or just talking hot air). It will even search in a selection of [my old blogposts on the bitcraze website](https://www.bitcraze.io/author/kimberly/) and refer to those directly to their website. I've got them rendered here again for you:

{{ list_unique_labels(lower_limit=5, star_threshold=3, small_star_threshold=1) }}

Have you tried clicking them yet?? It is apaprenetly not super apperent that htese are clickable... but I might be overoptmizing here. I'm already in the process of adding [the publications](/media/#publications) I've written to the search index as well, and thinking of letting my skill list be automatically generated based on all of that... but at one point I've got to start this thing called actual work and not work on my website for the rest of the year (but if I could... I would!).

## What kind of assignments?

So mainly I'm looking for short-term part time assignments, for about 8-16 hours per week. For those that have been following me might know already, but as a [previous cancer patient](/blog/2025/03/29/when-the-doctor-stops-smiling/) I have 3 monthly scans that I'll need to take into account. So going for short term assignments is not only a good reasoning for me, but also for the customer to expect specific deliverables in that timeframe and not be supriced of dropouts. I need to be ready to get into surgury at every 3 month interval, so I'll make pretty well sure that I'll be ready with something before then. So there, pretty important reason to go for **short-term contracts** so I hope that makes sense! Take a look at [my portfolio]() here.

Next to it, I do have some expertise in aerial robotics, swarm robotics and was a former employee of Bitcraze from the Crazyflie, so if anyone is interested in **strategic consulting**, I'll be able to offer that too at an hourly rate. If you'd like to make use of my accademic skills of doing a literature review  as **researcher** of the robotics field you are interested in, or help out with your own research subject. I could also help out of **training or educating** different concepts of my expertises to your employees or students. And if you happen to need a **speaker** at your conference or someone to **write an article** about an robotics event. I have plenty of examples of those on my [media page](/media)

In terms of topics, ofcourse I would be more than available to help out for those topics that I have experience in, which is aerial robotics and embedded systems. But, I do have to say that one of my drivers is to learn, so it will be an added benefit to have the oppertunity to work with something that is new that I can add to my portfolio, like another platform, robotics framework or simulator. The hourly rate can always be discussed if I'm a bit slower due needing to do the extra research but if the topic is worth it, then why not!

Please take a look at my [my website](https://knmcguire.github.io/) to see if there is a good fit or share it with anyone you think might be intersted. 


## Finally

Being self-employed is starting a business, and I need to start actually selling myself. My imposter syndrom brain is now shouting 'What are you saying!?' but... apparently I am quite smart and I catch on new things very quickly. I do not like overselling myself and I will not take on assignments that are neither my expertise or neither fit with my new learning goals, however I shouldn't undersell myself either. Switfching to ROS 2 and simulation was hard, doing a PhD was hard, switching from IDE to mechanical engineering was hard...  but I did it all. Now brain, could you please be a bit more positive!

I'd like to thank a couple of people that helpled me take this decision , and that is [Mat Sadowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateuszsadowski/) (who wrote some blogposts about being [an consultant](https://msadowski.github.io/5-years-remote-robotics-consulting/) as well), [Jennifer Beuhler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenbuehler/), and [JÃºlia Marsal Perendreu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliamarsalrobotics/). Thanks to these robotic contractor veterans, I got to know enough to take the leap into freelancing.

I'm actually quite excited about this! I'll try to give regular updates on process.
