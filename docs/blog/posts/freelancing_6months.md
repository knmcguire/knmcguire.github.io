Has it been 6 months already?! I can't believe how fast time has gone ever since I've decided to try out and go freelancing or being self-employeed. Still, I can't believe the many questions I get from various people about what my experience is. When I was just in ROSCon UK in Edinburgh, I was expecting more questions about my Aerial robotics or lightning talk about simulators, but 90% of the questions are: How is it to be a freelancer? and How do I become one? My general response, is to ask me again in a year, as it still feels to me like I just started... but I guess that I have learned a thing or two already that I could already share.

## How to freelance through?

When I started in April, I felt that I still needed to try this freelancing out in a more casual atmosphere. Since in Sweden it's quite the process and responsibilty to start an own company (even as sole propiertership), so I felt that it might be best to use a intermediary freelance company (egenanställd företag as it is called here). This means that I can still find and communicate with my own clients, but all agreements and invoicing go through one of these registered companies, which will handle my salary according to the Swedish law and I can make use of their insurances too. This ofcourse goes for a certain percentage of the earnings, which makes perfect sense ofcourse. 

Now at least, I feel more certain that indeed I would like to continue to be self-employed. The intermediary company has worked out so far but it is limiting in what kind of agreements I can take up, what kind of risk I can take for the assignments and which clients I can take on. It was never meant to be a long term solution, just a way for me to test the waters before I take the plundge. And that, it has succeeded with.

So I have decided to take my journey one step further into the void. Last month I've completed a course on how to start up my own business in Sweden, and currently am reviewing and finalizing my businessplan. Next up, is to start registering and signingup for an business account, bookkeeping service, tax registration... the works! So if everything goes well, I'll have my own actual company to start freelancing from in february 2026!

## Know when to start

INterstingly, when I started in April, I knew from other freelancers that it usually takes up a few months before you could actually sign on and start with assignments. "Perfect!" I thought, because then I can get started and have the full summer to work on these assignments. I might have been a little optimistic...

Getting leads and actually getting to a point that agreements have been signed and projects budgets have been accepted... takes time! And you really have to keep reminding your clients (and intermediary company in my case), to give updates and to try to finalize things. In the end, for me, that meant that I went into the summer without any assignments to start out with, and once the summer starts... things slow waaaaay down. Especially here in Sweden, but that also holds in other countries as well.

In hindsight, a tip that I could already give people, think about your timing. I thought end of April was a good time, but summer was already around the door and nobody will start anything new. If anything, try to announce your freelancing either at the end of summer, or in January, if you have the luxury to choice your start date at least. Luckily, this did give me time to work on personal projects and try some things out as content creating.

## Trying out streaming and content creating

I did have quite some time to work on my own projects during this slow time, and this is also a moment where I decided to try out... streaming! So there I went, with first a couple of streams about ROS - Gazebo on windows and WSL2, and then to have some tutorial streams about working with O3DE. With the last, since I didn't know it that well yet, I thought perhaps the best way to learn was to do a project, and present those project in tutorial style, live, on a stream. 

I do find learning quite important and if I can combine this with showing things on a stream, then I can do 2 things in a go. However, at the time, I already saw that (1) learning about a new framework (2) working on a project (3) preparing a tutorial and (4) presenting this material live... is a lot of work... and not sustainable if I would actually start with assignments myself. 

I still stream to this day, but I've converted to a format that is called Lofi builds. I don't take people by the hand through a project anymore, but it is just me working on these projects on a table with some music in the background. Less preparation, nice music, and it still forces me to learn something or to advane in a project at least (albeit a lower pace then the tutorial frenzy I did berfore). Maybe not the most exciting content, but this is something that very much works in my current schedule, and I guess that is the most important thing... to have something that you can keep up with in the long haul.

## So many types of assignments!

When I started freelancing, I was under the empression that it would mostly be hourly based technical consultancing, where companies charge me by the hour at a certain rate. However, now that I actually have signed several assignment types, I've now come to realize that there are very different formats. 

Yes, one of my assignments is an hourly rate based type of gig, but all the others are fixed price upon delivery, either for a full report, or for piece of finished code or node. It would perhaps make sense that a company would like to know the price of the whole lot so that it would be easier to budget it in?

Moreover, the range of assignments are very different. In one assignment I get to work with the code and telemetry of an actual robot, but one assignment is an research assignment with a report as delivierable. Another assignment is about writing a course about a topic of my expertise, and there have been several article writing offers as well. It (happily) supriced me that there is such a variety in gigs you can take on.

## Dealing with time

At one end, I did like that I had a lot of free time during the summer to truely work on my own projects or to help out others in certain open source projects. On the other hand... I'd also like to have a salary as well. Once I had those assignments planned in, I quickly realized that time wasn't my friend and that I had to step down on many of these side things that weren't paid.

All in all, in hindsight, 3 assignment at the same time for just starting out, is too much. I thought I was smart that I couldd at least start with one of these already in the summer but as you read before, that didn't really work out. Also, context switching is not something I'm very good at, so I need some good time to focus on one task before moving to another, like a good few days in a row. Luckily, I'm very fortunate that my clients are very understanding and that I was able to push some a bit later.

Also, the trips I had planned (and are coming up), are also something that really takes time. Yes, it is important to show your work off, and show your expertise, but preparing for these talks takes time (and always more than you think). Especially... when they are pretty much all about a different topic... Past Kimberly was perhaps a little bit too ambitious with all of those talk applications... and didn't realize what would happen if they all got accepted (whoops!)

In that sense, it is all part of the process. At least I'm glad that I didn't start out yet with registering my own company yet so that I could figure it all out at my own space. I'm sure that a future blogpost of mine will tell you all about the amount of time I'm losing just on administration and bookkeeping alone. 

## Dealing with Anxiety

Starting to freelancing, or to startup your own company, there is one thing that many don't mention you will need to take care of: your anxiety. To start with something, that will not ensure financial stability (at least at the start), where you are not sure if you will be in demand, and where there are so many unknowns... are nice fuel for this little monster (remember anxiety from Inside Out 2?)

Evenghtough it is not as bad as it was, but I for sure had a lot of moments of, 'will I have enough to aissignment', 'is my focus in the right direction right way', 'is this still something that I'll be enjoying in a year' or most importantly 'am I doing a good enough job for my client'. Especially when there are so many projects happening in my head at once, it is difficult to not be too overwhelmed. Especially when you already have a bad case of the imposter syndrom (PhD of what?)

What helped me, was to have a certain type of acceptance of observing that this is htting me and have a toolbelt of actions you can do. Do I have a down day, maybe I'll work on an assignment that is just your typical grunt work. Do I feel I've been working on the same piece of problem, step back and work on my robot arm for a while. Also, communicating with your client to make sure that you are the same line, is quite important as well, as it is not only for your own anxiety, it is also for theirs, so communicating about your process is important. 

Anxiety and independence is what is part of being a freelancer. Remembering why you are are doing it for, and which projects aor prospects excite you, is something that you can at least tame your anxiety with. I am still learning to enhance my toolkit, but I am improving a lot!

## To conclude

Yes... 6 months went by so fast, but looking back, I guess I already learned a lot! And there have been already quite a lot of projects I've been involved with. Basically, I'm starting to learn about enterpreneurship, had my first hand and content creating, learned about what type of assignmetns or oppertunities there are and getting better and better in managing both my time, and anxiety. 

I do note that I'm quite the open book with these kinds of things, and can only really give my honest opinion and experience on my current freelance advanture. I do hope that I didn't put anyone off with this blog, but yes freelancing might not be something that anyone will be ready for. 

For me, if you ask me if I regret my decision, I absolutely do not. Yes, there are many things I'm still unsure about, but this prospect of independence and the possibilities that comes with it, is something that is very exciting!
